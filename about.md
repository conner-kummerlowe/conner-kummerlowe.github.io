Originally from a forested exurb of Seattle, WA, I moved to Southern California to study at Pomona College, where I obtained my Bachelors in Chemistry with a minor in Mathematics. Braving the heat of the the SoCal summer, I worked in the laboratory of Professor Malkiat Johal for three years, using Surface Chemistry methods to study the binding of biological dyes and the hydration of optically active polymers with applications in solar cell technology.
